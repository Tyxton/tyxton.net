        <h1>Web-Based Music!</h1>
	<p>Ok, so as it turns out <a href="mail.html">setting up a mail service</a>is not only mildly frustrating, but is also rather difficult to configure the DNS settings properly post-setup. So, before I cause myself too much extra grief, I have decided to put a temporary hold to the project and instead work on something else I'vewanted to for some time.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Now, let it be known I have very little experience in HTML and CSS, and my C++ and Python work is rusty at best, but I've been wanting to develop a web-based music player for locally stored files on the site. This would be in order to compliment <a href="music.html">/music/</a>. At the moment I use mpd and ncmpcpp for a large majority of my music that I listen to, so I have access to a lot of internally stored music. Now, in theory I would be able to transfer the music from my laptop to the server and not only run the music files globally, but potentially use it for the site as well!</p> <br> <p>The idea initially was to link the ablum art in <a href="music.html">/music/</a> to a spotify link to the album, sure it works, but that's no fun! Instead what I'm aiming to do is have it linked to something like tyxton.net/music/ and then have a seperate GUI to run the music files which I'll work on at a later date. Very early on (and partially as a joke) I uploaded <a href="https://www.tyxton.net/girl.mp3">No Buses - Girl</a> to the website directory. As you can tell, not only is it viewable, but you can also play it through the browser. So if I could not only get it to work with a lot of music in the same directory (/music/) then I would be able to improve the GUI for the software(?) because hosting the individual files works, yes, but its incredibly crude.</p>
    	<h2>UPDATE: 7th June, 2022 </h2>
	<p> So as I've learned the hard way, it seems that it is near impossible to make a music player in the web-browser without utilizing JavaScript, something I thought I would be able to avoid doing when starting the project. So I regret to admit that I will be dropping the project as I wish to keep this site JavaScript free.</p>
